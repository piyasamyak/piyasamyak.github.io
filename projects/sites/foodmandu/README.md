# About
## This project is a redesign of "Foodmandu" (https://www.foodmandu.com), a food delivery service in Kathmandu, Nepal.

- CSS3 Grids 

# Goal
- Create a responsive and beautiful website without using any CSS3 frameworks but built-in CSS3 Grids instead.

# What I Learned
-
-Image optimization for a faster screen rendering time.

It is an attempt to create a beautiful-looking website using only HTML5 and CSS3.
No CSS3 frameworks have been used. The layout and responsiveness of the site was structured using CSS3 Grids.
However, a jQuery plugin called "waypoints" has also been used to trigger site animations when a certain point in the page has been reached.
