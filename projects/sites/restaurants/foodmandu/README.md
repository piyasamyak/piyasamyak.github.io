This project is a casual redesign of Foodmandu, a food delivery service in Nepal. (https://www.foodmandu.com)

It is an attempt to create a beautiful-looking website using only HTML5 and CSS3.
However, a jQuery plugin called "waypoints" has also been used to trigger site animations when a certain point in the page has been reached.

Note: The page currently has no backend functionality.
