This project is a casual redesign of Foodmandu (https://www.foodmandu.com), a food delivery service in Nepal, for improving my CSS3 skills. 

It is an attempt to create a beautiful-looking website using only HTML5 and CSS3.
No CSS3 frameworks have been used. The layout and responsiveness of the site was structured using CSS3 Grids.
However, a jQuery plugin called "waypoints" has also been used to trigger site animations when a certain point in the page has been reached.

Note: The page currently has no backend functionality.
