- This project is my attempt on the redesign of the website, "Foodmandu" (https://www.foodmandu.com), a food delivery service in Kathmandu, Nepal.

## About
- CSS3 Grids are used to structure the layout of the page.
- A CSS library called animate.css is used to tweak in different animations.
- Media queries are applied on CSS Rows and Columns templates for responsiveness.
- A jQuery plugin called "waypoints" is implemented to trigger animations exactly when a certain point in the page has been reached.

## What I Learned
- Efficient and organized writing of CSS3 code.
- Implementation of CSS3 Libraries (animate.css).
- Implementation of jQuery Plugins (waypoint.js).
- Image and code optimization for a faster website rendering time.
